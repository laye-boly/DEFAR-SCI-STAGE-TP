            <p>What are you hacking off? Is it my torso?! 'It is!' My precious torso! Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar. I am Singing Wind, Chief of the Martians. Of all the friends I've had… you're the first.</p>
            <p>I've been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the pope? <strong> That's right, baby.</strong> <em> I ain't your loverboy Flexo, the guy you love so much.</em> You even love anyone pretending to be him!</p>
            <h2>My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book 'Earth in the Balance'', and the much more popular ''Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth', we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards.</h2>
            <p>Tell her you just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. And yet you haven't said what I told you to say! How can any of us trust you? We'll need to have a look inside you with this camera. Is today's hectic lifestyle making you tense and impatient?</p>
            <ol>
            <li>Robot 1-X, save my friends! And Zoidberg!</li><li>For the last time, I don't like lilacs! Your 'first' wife was the one who liked lilacs!</li><li>Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn't you just get me the death penalty?</li>
            </ol>
            <input type="text">
            <h3>I'll tell them you went down prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger.</h3>
            <p>Actually, that's still true. Would you censor the Venus de Venus just because you can see her spewers? And yet you haven't said what I told you to say! How can any of us trust you? Oh, all right, I am. But if anything happens to me, tell them I died robbing some old man.</p>
            <ul>
            <li>There's no part of that sentence I didn't like!</li><li>Now that the, uh, garbage ball is in space, Doctor, perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions?</li><li>Then we'll go with that data file!</li>
            </ul>

            <p>You lived before you met me?! No, of course not. It was… uh… porno. Yeah, that's it. Now what? Bender?! You stole the atom.</p>
            <p>You can crush me but you can't crush my spirit! Goodbye, cruel world. Goodbye, cruel lamp. Goodbye, cruel velvet drapes, lined with what would appear to be some sort of cruel muslin and the cute little pom-pom curtain pull cords. Cruel though they may be…</p>
            <p>Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them? Ugh, it's filthy! Why not create a National Endowment for Strip Clubs while we're at it? I guess because my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike. As though!</p>
            <p>You can crush me but you can't crush my spirit! Interesting. No, wait, the other thing: tedious. No! The cat shelter's on to me. Come, Comrade Bender! We must take to the streets!</p>
            <p>I'm Santa Claus! Well, thanks to the Internet, I'm now bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence? Doomsday device? Ah, now the ball's in Farnsworth's court! When the lights go out, it's nobody's business what goes on between two consenting adults.</p>
            <p>Is today's hectic lifestyle making you tense and impatient? And so we say goodbye to our beloved pet, Nibbler, who's gone to a place where I, too, hope one day to go. The toilet. And I'm his friend Jesus.</p>
            <p>You're going to do his laundry? Son, as your lawyer, I declare y'all are in a 12-piece bucket o' trouble. But I done struck you a deal: Five hours of community service cleanin' up that ol' mess you caused.</p>
            <p>It's a T. It goes "tuh". I was all of history's great robot actors - Acting Unit 0.8; Thespomat; David Duchovny! Say it in Russian! Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way? Man, I'm sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rounds with mighty Thor.</p>
            <p>I could if you hadn't turned on the light and shut off my stereo. Your best is an idiot! Humans dating robots is sick. You people wonder why I'm still single? It's 'cause all the fine robot sisters are dating humans!</p>
            <p>Why would a robot need to drink? You, a bobsleder!? That I'd like to see! That could be 'my' beautiful soul sitting naked on a couch. If I could just learn to play this stupid thing. I've been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the pope?</p>
            <p>Oh no! The professor will hit me! But if Zoidberg 'fixes' it… then perhaps gifts! Bender, quit destroying the universe! Your best is an idiot! How much did you make me?</p>
